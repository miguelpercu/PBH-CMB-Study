Evolution of Primordial Black Holes and Their Impact on the Cosmic Microwave Background
This repository contains the materials for the study "Evolution of Primordial Black Holes and Their Impact on the Cosmic Microwave Background: A Numerical Study" by Miguel Ángel Percudani (Independent Non-Conventional Scientific Researcher, Buenos Aires, Argentina), dated April 25, 2025.
Overview
We present a numerical study on the evolution of primordial black holes (PBHs) with an initial mass of ( 10^{12} , \mathrm{kg} ) in the early universe at redshift ( z = 1089 ), corresponding to the recombination epoch. We introduce the novel concept of "applicable time" (( t_{\mathrm{applied}} )) to adjust the temporal scale of cosmological simulations, enabling the modeling of dynamic processes such as Hawking radiation, the accumulation of dark matter (( \rho_{\mathrm{DM}} )), dark energy (( \rho_{\mathrm{DE}} )), and their impact on the cosmic microwave background (CMB).
Key Findings

PBHs with ( M_0 = 10^{12} , \mathrm{kg} ) have a negligible impact on the CMB at ( z = 1089 ), with spectral distortion ( y \approx 1.09 \times 10^{-23} ) and ionization fraction change ( \Delta x_e \approx 1.03 \times 10^{-23} ).
The PBH mass decreases from ( 1.00 \times 10^{12} , \mathrm{kg} ) to ( 9.92 \times 10^{11} , \mathrm{kg} ).
( \rho_{\mathrm{DM}} ) increases from ( 1.00 \times 10^8 , \mathrm{kg/m}^3 ) to ( 1.05 \times 10^8 , \mathrm{kg/m}^3 ), and ( \rho_{\mathrm{DE}} ) from ( 1.00 \times 10^{-10} , \mathrm{kg/m}^3 ) to ( 1.01 \times 10^{-10} , \mathrm{kg/m}^3 ).
Total dark matter mass (( MO )) decreases from ( 1.05 \times 10^{-7} , \mathrm{kg} ) to ( 1.02 \times 10^{-7} , \mathrm{kg} ), and total dark energy (( EO )) from ( 9.43 \times 10^9 , \mathrm{J} ) to ( 9.22 \times 10^9 , \mathrm{J} ).
Effective Hawking temperature (( T_H' )) increases from ( 1.22 \times 10^{-3} , \mathrm{K} ) to ( 1.25 \times 10^{-3} , \mathrm{K} ), and emitted particle energy (( E_{\mathrm{part}} )) from ( 4.52 \times 10^{-26} , \mathrm{J} ) to ( 4.57 \times 10^{-26} , \mathrm{J} ).

scipy

Install them using pip:
pip install numpy matplotlib scipy

How to Use

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/miguelpercu/PBH-CMB-Study.git
cd PBH-CMB-Study


Run the Simulation:

Navigate to the code/ directory:cd code


Execute the Python script:python pbh_cmb_simulation.py


This will generate the figures (figura1.png to figura6.png) in the figures/ directory and print the simulation results to the console.


View the Results:

Check the figures/ directory for the generated plots.
The printed output includes values of ( M ), ( \rho_{\mathrm{DM}} ), ( \rho_{\mathrm{DE}} ), ( MO ), ( EO ), ( T_H' ), and ( E_{\mathrm{part}} ) at selected ( t_{\mathrm{applied}} ) points.



Simulation Details
The script pbh_cmb_simulation.py performs the following:

Calculates ( t_{\mathrm{applied}} ) using redshift ( z = 1089 ).
Simulates the evolution of PBH mass (( M )) via Hawking radiation.
Solves differential equations for ( \rho_{\mathrm{DM}} ) and ( \rho_{\mathrm{DE}} ) using scipy.integrate.solve_ivp.
Computes total dark matter mass (( MO )) and dark energy (( EO )) with linear adjustments.
Calculates the effective Hawking temperature (( T_H' )) and emitted particle energy (( E_{\mathrm{part}} )).
Generates six figures showing the evolution of key quantities.
